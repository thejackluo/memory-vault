Get your interactive knowledge graph up and running in 3 minutes!

## What You'll Get

Transform your ChatGPT conversations into a beautiful, interactive graph showing:
- **👥 People** you've discussed
- **🚀 Projects** you're working on
- **💡 Knowledge** you've learned
- **❓ Questions** you've asked
- **💭 Thoughts** and ideas
- **🔗 Connections** between everything

## Prerequisites

✅ Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
✅ Your `conversations.json` file from ChatGPT export

> **Don't have your data?** Go to [ChatGPT Settings](https://chat.openai.com/settings) → Data Controls → Export Data

## Installation (30 seconds)

### Option 1: Simple (Just Drop Files)
1. Put `conversations.json` in the same folder as `memory-graph.html`
2. Double-click `memory-graph.html`
3. Done! 🎉

### Option 2: With Local Server (Recommended)
```bash
# In the project folder
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open: http://localhost:8000/memory-graph.html
```

## First Run (30-40 seconds)

1. **Welcome Screen**: You'll see a beautiful intro with 6 feature cards
2. **Click "Process My Conversations"**: This starts the magic
3. **Watch Progress**: Live stats show:
   - Conversations processed (500 at a time!)
   - Entities discovered
   - Progress percentage
4. **Graph Appears**: Your memory graph loads with a smooth animation

> ⏱️ Processing time: ~30-40 seconds for 5,000 conversations (5x faster than v3.0!)

## Subsequent Visits (Instant!)

**Good news**: You only need to process once! 

- Data is saved in your browser (IndexedDB)

## Pro Tips

### 🚀 Performance
- **Adjust Entity Density**: Settings → Minimum occurrences (default: 2)
  - Higher = denser graph with frequently-mentioned entities only
  - Lower = includes more entities (may be sparse)
- Hide unused entity types to improve speed

| `Scroll` | Zoom in/out |

## Common Questions

### "Processing is taking forever!"
- Should take 30-40 seconds for 5,000 conversations
- If much slower, check browser console for errors
- Close other tabs to free up memory
- **New in v3.1**: 5x faster than before!

### "Do I need to reprocess every time?"
- No! Processing is done once and saved
- Data persists in IndexedDB (browser storage)
- Next visit: Instant load
- Only processes new conversations if you add more

### "How do I add new conversations?"
1. Export new data from ChatGPT
2. Replace `conversations.json` with updated file
3. Click "Resume / Add New Conversations"
4. Only new conversations will be processed (very fast!)

### "I found a duplicate entity"
- Entity merging UI is planned for future version
- For now, they'll appear as separate nodes

### "Can I edit entities?"
- Manual editing coming in future version
- You can export and manually edit the JSON

### "Where is my data stored?"
- In your browser's IndexedDB (local only)
- No data sent to any server
- Survives browser restarts
- Clearing browser data will delete it

### "How accurate is entity extraction?"
- ~80% accuracy with rule-based approach
- Some false positives/negatives expected
- LLM-based extraction planned for higher accuracy

## Export Your Graph

1. Click ⚙️ (Settings) button
2. Click "Export Memory Graph"
3. Save the JSON file as backup

You can share this file with others or reimport it later!

## File Checklist

Make sure you have all these files in the same directory:

```
✅ conversations.json          (your ChatGPT export)
✅ memory-graph.html           (main app)
✅ memory-graph.css            (styling)
✅ memory-graph-app.js         (app logic)
✅ db-manager.js               (database)
✅ memory-processor.js         (entity extraction)
✅ graph-renderer.js           (visualization)
✅ timeline-view.js            (timeline)
✅ entity-panel.js             (detail panel)
✅ search-engine.js            (search)
✅ processing-worker.js        (optional, for Web Workers)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to load conversations.json"
**Fix**: Make sure `conversations.json` is in the same folder as `memory-graph.html`

### Error: "Browser not supported"
**Fix**: Use a modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)

### Graph is laggy with many nodes
**Fix**: 
- Use filters to hide entity types
- Search for specific entities
- Close other browser tabs

### Data disappeared after refresh
**Fix**: 
- IndexedDB data persists normally
- Check if you cleared browser data
- Export your graph regularly as backup
